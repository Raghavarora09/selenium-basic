# Selenium Web Automation Exercise

This repository contains files for a Selenium web automation exercise. The goal of this assignment is to introduce you to web automation using Selenium by creating a custom HTML page with various elements and then writing a Python Selenium script to interact with these elements.

## Files

- `page.html`: HTML file containing a custom registration form with various elements such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus.
- `auto.py`: Python script using Selenium WebDriver to interact with the `page.html` and perform tasks such as filling out the form and submitting it.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the Selenium script.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

git clone https://github.com/Raghavarora09/selenium-basic.git


2. **Navigate to Repository**: Change directory to the cloned repository.

cd selenium-web-automation


3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and Selenium WebDriver installed. You can install Selenium using pip.

pip install selenium


4. **Download WebDriver**: Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome) and place it in a directory accessible from your PATH.

5. **Run the Selenium Script**: Execute the `auto.py` using Python.

python auto.py


This script will open the `page.html` in a browser, interact with the elements of the registration form, and submit it. You will see the actions being performed in the browser window.

6. **Verify Results**: After running the script, verify that the form has been submitted successfully. You can check the console output for a confirmation message.
